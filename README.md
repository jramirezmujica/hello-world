# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I Learn C# programming but the more I learned the more I realize how little I know. Also I learned that outside the windows eviroment I have no value at all. Moreover, there is a huge amout of free software that can help me accomplish just as much as I want to.
That is the main reason I am on Git Hub, to learn.
